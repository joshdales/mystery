CHOICES

First Choice: Stick with the PB&J your mom packed you. You're really looking forward to those Hip Tunes.
Second Choice: Get to work helping. Take a look around the room. Look for people and things that look suspicious or stand out. The sooner begun, the sooner done.
Third Choice: Approach Helga and the Doctor
Fourth Choice: Listen in on what they're saying
Fifth Choice: Approach Billy
Sikth Choice: Listen in on what he's saying

CLUE: Helga was standing nearest to Mr. Body when the murder took place, and had the clearest path to him.
CLUE: Billy seems to be making a lot of silly excuses for some reason
